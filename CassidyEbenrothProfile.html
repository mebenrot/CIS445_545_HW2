        <p>
            I enjoy videogames<br>
         I grew up in a household with 2 cats<br>
            I have been interested in computers since I learned what they were
        </p>
        <h2>reflection</h2>
        <p>
            growing up, learning was a bit tricky for me. once I got to highschool things really came into focus and I was doing great for a while.
             freshman and sophmore years of collage have been pretty simple and straightforward but my junior and senior years are getting challenging.<br>
            I hope to someday be able to work from home. I don't need to make a lot, just enough to be comfortable. 
            I wanna be able to travel the world.
        </p>
