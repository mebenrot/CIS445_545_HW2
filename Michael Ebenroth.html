            growing up, learning was a bit tricky for me. once I got to highschool things really came into focus and I was doing great for a while.
             freshman and sophmore years of collage have been pretty simple and straightforward but now that Im in my junior year things are
              getting challenging.<br>
            I hope to someday be able to work from home. I don't need to make a lot, just enough to be comfortable. 
            I wanna be able to travel the world.

            honestly Im glad I made it this far.<br>
            school has been something I've always struggled with being motivated towards but I'm glad I was able to hold out for this long
